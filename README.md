# Libft
My very first library at 42!

# Contents
This project was about writing useful functions that I used over the course of my curriculum at 42 Heilbronn.

Rewriting popular functions that are already present in the string library allowed me to put newly acquired C programming language concepts, not only that, the project requires you to reimplement many string manipulation functions such as ft_split and ft_strjoin that are very useful, such functions normally are practically builtins in other languages like c++ but not in C, thus implementing them was very helpful for the rest of the projects and gave me valuable insight as to how the C language works.
